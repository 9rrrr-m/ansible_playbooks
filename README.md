# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible

This project includes a series of Ansible playbooks created to streamline large-scale server deployment and automation. These playbooks are designed to automate common tasks, ensure consistency, and enable rapid configuration across multiple servers.

## Features
- **Scalability**: Deploy configurations across a large number of servers efficiently.
- **Automation**: Reduce manual steps by automating tasks like software installation, configuration, and updates.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that all servers have the same configuration, reducing potential errors and improving reliability.
- **Flexibility**: Customize playbooks to meet specific requirements of different environments or projects.

## Prerequisites
- **Ansible**: Ensure Ansible is installed on the control machine.
- **Inventory File**: Define target servers in an inventory file.
- **SSH Access**: Set up SSH keys for passwordless authentication between the control node and target servers.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
2. Edit the inventory file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your target servers.

3. Run the playbook:

   ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory your_playbook.yml
